### Essential Settings

Edit these at the top of `studocu_capture.py`:

```python
# Your Studocu document URL
URL = "https://www.studocu.com/bg/document/..."

# Output filenames
OUTPUT_DIR = Path("my_document")        # Temp folder

CHROME_PATH = Path(r"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")
```

### Advanced Options

```python
# PDF quality
PDF_DPI = 300                # Higher = better quality, larger file

# Screenshot size
VIEWPORT_WIDTH = 1225        # Browser width
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 1585       # Browser height

# Header/footer removal (as ratio of page height)
TOP_CROP_RATIO = 0.08        # Remove top 8%
BOTTOM_CROP_RATIO = 0.07     # Remove bottom 7%
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chrome doesn't open

**Problem:** `FileNotFoundError: Chrome not found`

**Fix:** Update `CHROME_PATH` in the script
```python
# Find Chrome location:
# Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
# Mac: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome  
# Linux: /usr/bin/google-chrome
```

### Can't connect to Chrome

**Problem:** `Failed to connect to Chrome on port 9222`

**Fix:**
1. Close all Chrome windows
2. Run script again
3. If still failing, change `PORT = 9222` to `9223`

### Document doesn't load

**Problem:** `Document viewer didn't load`

**Fix:**
- Check URL is correct
- Make sure you're logged into Studocu
- Try opening URL manually in the Chrome window first

### Login required every time

**Problem:** Chrome doesn't remember login

**Fix:** Don't delete `USER_DATA_DIR` folder between runs. Keep it to maintain sessions.

### Blurry PDF

**Problem:** Text isn't crisp

**Fix:** Increase quality settings
```python
PDF_DPI = 600              # Higher quality
VIEWPORT_WIDTH = 1600      # Larger screenshots
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 2000
```

### Headers/footers still visible

**Problem:** UI elements in screenshots

**Fix:** Adjust crop ratios
```python
TOP_CROP_RATIO = 0.12      # Crop more from top
BOTTOM_CROP_RATIO = 0.10   # Crop more from bottom
```

## 💡 Tips

### First Time Setup

1. **Run once to log in:**
   ```bash
   python studocu_capture.py
   ```
2. **Log into Studocu** in the Chrome window
3. **Close Chrome**
4. **Run again** - you'll stay logged in

### Multiple Documents

Create a simple loop:
```python
documents = [
    ("doc1", "https://studocu.com/document/1"),
    ("doc2", "https://studocu.com/document/2"),
]

for name, url in documents:
    URL = url
    OUTPUT_PDF = Path(f"{name}.pdf")
    # ... run capture
```

### Optimize File Size

Reduce PDF size:
```python
PDF_DPI = 150              # Lower quality
VIEWPORT_WIDTH = 1000      # Smaller screenshots
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 1300
```
